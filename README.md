## User Stories

```text
As a user, when I arrive at the home page:
  - I see a navigation bar on the top
  - I see an "Add Post" button that, when clicked, displays a form containing the following fields:
    - Title
    - Body
    - Author
  - Below the "Add Post button", I see list of post titles and only 30 characters of the body

- As a user, when I submit the add post form, the post is added to the bottom of the list

- As a user, after I submit the add post form, the form fields disappear
